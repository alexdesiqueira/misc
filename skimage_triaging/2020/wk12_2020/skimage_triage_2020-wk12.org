** Merged PRs

- [[https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4519][#4519 — Fix ~exposure_adapthist~ return when ~clip_limit == 1~]]

*Relevant points:*
  1. The output datatype of ~skimage.exposure.exposure_adapthist~ was different,
     depending on the value of ~clip_limit~. Now it will always be float.

- [[https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4518][#4518 — Fixing order of elements in docstrings of ~skimage/color/colorconv~]]

*Relevant points:*
  1. docstrings on ~skimage.color.colorconv~ had elements with order
     different than given on numpy documents. Some small changes on text
     as well.


** Closed PRs

- [[https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4510][#4510 — add cast to minimum dtype before ~imsave~]]

*Relevant points:*
  1. majority against ``magic'', i.e. unseen/unknown-to-the-user data
     conversion on ~skimage~.
  2. ~@emmanuelle~ pointed [[https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.min_scalar_type.html?highlight=min_scalar_type#numpy.min_scalar_type][~np.min_scalar_type~]] to downcast data to
     the smallest data type compatible with the data range.


* Issues

** New issues

- [[https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4520][#4520 — Changes required in Contributing.txt file > Info for venv activation on CONTRIBUTING.txt does not suit Windows]]

- [[https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4516][#4516 — Setting clip-limit to 1 does not return original image. > ~exposure.equalize_adapthist~ changes output datatype]]

- [[https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4514][#4514 — Specify that ~rgb2lab~ function is relative only to sRGB colorspace]]

- [[https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4513][#4513 — Add example of natsort usage in documentation]]


** Closed issues

- [[https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4516][#4516 — Setting clip-limit to 1 does not return original image. > ~exposure.equalize_adapthist~ changes output datatype]]

*Relevant points:*
  1. Solved by [[https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4519][#4519]].

- [[https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4509][#4509 — saving a ~np.uint64~ to png removes (low contrast) image content]]

*Relevant points:*
  1. ~@psteinb~ says he does not see a reason for dropping data.
  2. as pointed by ~@rfezzani~, this was an expected result — a warning is
     raised in this specific case. He points also that we use `imageio`
     when saving images, and they have the same behavior.
